'''LIST - A collection of items in a particular order, 
no relation required bcoz list usually contaiins more than one element (letters, digits or names)
[] indicate list and elements are separated by commas'''

bicycles = ['trek', 'cannondale', 'redline', 'specialized']
print(bicycles)     # output of list - includes square brackets


''' ACCESSING ELEMENTS IN A LIST '''

# Lists are ordered collections, 
# so you can access any element in a list by telling Python the position, or index, of the item desired.
# Index position starts at 0 - common error --> off-by-one error

print(bicycles[0])   # output of list - excludes square brackets and provides clean, neatly formatted output

print(bicycles[0].title())

print(bicycles[-1])     # Accesing last element in the list

message = f"My first bicycle was a {bicycles[3].title()}"
print(message)



'''MODIFYING, ADDING and REMOVING elements'''

# Most lists you create will be DYNAMIC,
# Meaning you’ll build a list and then add and remove elements from it as your program runs its course.

bicycles[0] = 'hero'    # Modify an element
print(bicycles)

bicycles.append('atlas')    # append() method makes it easy to build lists dynamically, start with empty list and keep appending
print(bicycles)

indian_brand_bicycles = []
indian_brand_bicycles.append('BSA')
indian_brand_bicycles.append('hero')
indian_brand_bicycles.append('hercules')
print(indian_brand_bicycles)

# insert() method adds the element at desired position in the list,
# thereby shifting every other value in the list one postion to the right
indian_brand_bicycles.insert(1, 'atlas')    
print(indian_brand_bicycles)

# If you know the position (index) of the item you want to remove from a list,
# you can use the del statement: 
# you can no longer access the value that was removed from the list after the del statement is used.

del indian_brand_bicycles[1]
print(indian_brand_bicycles)

'''Removing an item using the POP() method'''
# Sometimes you’ll want to use the value of an item after you remove it from a list.
# For example, you might want to remove a user from a list of active members 
# and then add that user to a list of inactive members.

# The pop() method removes the last item in a list, but it lets you work with that item after removing it.

popped_indian_brand_bicycles = indian_brand_bicycles.pop()
print(indian_brand_bicycles)            # ouput - list after popped element
print(popped_indian_brand_bicycles)     # output - popped element, we still have access to the value that was removed

last_owned_bicycle = popped_indian_brand_bicycles
print(f"My last owned bicycle was {last_owned_bicycle}")


first_owned = indian_brand_bicycles.pop(1)
print(f"My first owned indian brand bicycle was {first_owned.title()}")

'''when you want to delete an item from a list and not use that item in any way, use the del statement;
if you want to use an item after you remove it, use the pop() method.'''


'''REMOVING THE ITEM BY VALUE'''
# Sometimes you won’t know the position of the value you want to remove from a list.
# If you only know the value of the item you want to remove, you can use the remove() method.

all_bicycles = ['trek', 'cannondale', 'redline', 'specialized', 'hero', 'hercules', 'atlas']
print(all_bicycles)

# remove() method tells Python to figure out where 'specialized' appears in the list and remove that element
all_bicycles.remove('specialized')
print(all_bicycles)

too_expensive = 'redline'
all_bicycles.remove(too_expensive)
print(all_bicycles)
print(f"My most expensive bicycle was {too_expensive.title()}")

''' remove() method deletes only the first occurrence of the value you specify. 
If there’s a possibility the value appears more than once in the list, 
you’ll need to use a loop to make sure all occurrences of the value are removed.'''
