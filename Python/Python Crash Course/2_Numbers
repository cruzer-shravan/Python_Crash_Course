'''NUMBERS'''

# OPERATIONS (+  -   *   /   **)
# SUPPORTS ORDER OF OPERATIONS

2 + 3 * 4       # 14
(2 + 3) * 4     # 20
# Spacing in these examples has no effect on how Python evaluates the expressions


'''FLOATS - Number with a decimal point'''

# sometimes get an arbitrary number of decimal places in your answer
0.2 + 0.1
0.30000000000000004     # Python tries to find a way to represent the result as precisely as possible


'''INTEGERS AND FLOATS'''

# When you divide any two numbers, even if they are integers that result in a whole number,
# you’ll always get a float

4/2 = 2.0
1 + 2.0 = 3.0


'''UNDERSCORES IN NUMBERS'''
# group digits using underscores to make large numbers more readable

universe_age = 14_000_000_000


'''MULTIPLE ASSIGNMENT - assign values to more than one variable using just a single line of code'''

x, y, z = 0, 1, 2   # shorten the program, easy to read


'''CONSTANTS - variable whose value stays the same throughout the life of a program.'''
# CONSTANT Variables are always indicated in CAPITAL LETTERS and never be changed

MAX_CONNECTIONS = 5_000


'''COMMENTS (#) - add notes within your programs that describe your overall approach to the problem you’re solving'''
# The main reason to write comments is to explain what your code is supposed to do and how you are making it work.
# Professional programmers write meaningful comments and expect to see comment in code, 
# so it's best to start adding descriptive comments to your programs.

# Say hi to everyone
print("Hi everyone!")


'''ZEN OF PYTHON by TIM PETERS - Brief set of principles for writing good Python code'''

# Beautiful is better than ugly.    "Wow, that's some beautiful code!"

# Simple solution is better than complex, bcoz simple is easy to maintain and easy to build on top of that code.

# Complex is better than Complicated (Readability counts)

# Focus on writing informative comments for that code.

# There should be one -- and preferablt only one -- obvious way to do it

# The nuts and bolts of the programs should make sense to other Python programmers

# Now is better than Never - Don’t try to write perfect code; write code that works, and then decide
# whether to improve your code for that project or move on to something new
