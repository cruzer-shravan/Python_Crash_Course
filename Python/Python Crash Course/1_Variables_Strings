'''VARIABLES'''

# Running Variables.py
print("Hello Python world!")   # Syntax highlighting feature - "Hello Python world!" phrase in different color

message = "Hello Python world!"
print(message)

message = "Hello Python Crash Course World!"    # variable value changed
print(message)

# Variable names can contain only letters, numbers and underscore. They should be short and descriptive
# They start with letter or an underscore but not with number.
# Spaces are not allowed but underscores can be used to separate words e.g. good_morning_message
# Avoid using Python Keywords and Built-in Functions


'''STRINGS - A series of characters (anything inside the quotes)'''

'I told my friend, "Python is my fav language" '
"The langugage 'Python' is named after Monty Python, not the snake."
"One of Python's strengths is its diverse and supportive comm unity."

# Changing case in a string

name = "hyderabad sunrisers"
print(name)
print(name.title())         # method title().

# Method is an action that Python can perform on a piece of data. 
# The dot (.) after name in name.title() tells Python to make the title() method act on the variable name.

name = "Sunrisers Hyderabad"
print(name.upper())
print(name.lower())     # The lower() method is particularly useful for storing data.

'''USING VARIABLES IN STRINGS'''

first_name = "william"
last_name = "shakespeare"

full_name = f"{first_name} {last_name}"     # f-strings. 
# The f is for format, because Python formats the string by replacing 
# the name of any variable in braces with its value.

print(full_name)
print(full_name.upper())
print(full_name.lower())

print(f"Hello, {full_name.title()}")

message = f"Hello, {full_name.upper()}"
print(message)


'''Adding Whitespace to Strings with TABS or NEWLINES'''
# In programming, whitespace refers to any nonprinting characters, such as SPACES, TABs, and END-of-LINE symbols.
# You can use whitespace to organize your output so it’s easier for users to read.

print("Python")
print("\tPython")       # add a TAB
print("Langugaes\nPython\nC#\nJavaScript")  # add a NEWLINE
print("Langugaes\n\tPython\n\tC#\n\tJavaScript")  # add a NEWLINE with TAB


'''STRIPPING WHITESPACE'''

# Extra whitespace can be confusing in your programs. Eg. checking people's username
# Python detects the extra space in 'python ' and considers it significant unless you tell it otherwise.

fav_language = "python "
fav_language.rstrip()       # rstrip method - NO whitespace exists at the right side of a string
fav_language

# To remove the whitespace from the string permanently - associate stripped value with the variable name
fav_language = fav_language.rstrip()    
fav_language

fav_language1 = " JavaScript"
fav_language1
fav_language1 = fav_language.lstrip()       # lstrip method - No whitespace exists at the left side of a string
fav_language1

# Experimenting with these stripping functions can help you become familiar with manipulating strings.
# In the real world, these stripping functions are used most often to clean up user input 
# before it’s stored in a program.

fav_language2 = " C++ "
fav_language2
fav_language2.strip()   # strip method - strips both ends


'''REMOVING PREFIXES'''
# Consider a URL with the common prefix "https://"".
# we want to remove this prefix, so we can focus on just the part of the URL that users need to enter into an address bar
# When you see a URL in an address bar and the https:// part isn’t shown,
# the browser is probably using a method like removeprefix() behind the scenes.

google_url = 'https://www.google.com'
google_url.removeprefix('https://')     # removeprefix() leaves the original string unchanged

simple_url = google_url.removeprefix('https://')
simple_url

'''Avoiding Syntax Errors with Strings - Refer Appendix C of book'''
# A syntax error occurs when Python doesn’t recognize a section of your program as valid Python code
